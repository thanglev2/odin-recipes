    <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Marrow bones and Meaty bones</li>
            <li>Thinly sliced raw beef</li>
            <li>Yellow onions</li>
            <li>Whole garlic</li>
            <li>Fresh ginger</li>
            <li>Whoel Spices: star anise, cloves, cinnamon sticks, black cardamom pods, fennel seeds, coriander seeds</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Fish sauce</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>STEPS</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Blanch the bones. Divide the bones between two large pots or stockpots. Cover with cold water. Bringto a boil over high heat and simmer for 15-20 minutes. Drain and rinse the bones with water.</li>
        <li>Roast the bones and vegatables. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Transfer the bones, onion, garlic, and ginger to the roasting pans or rimmed baking sheets. Roast for 30 minutes before gently tossing the obnes, and roasting for an additional 15-30 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Toast the spices a large skillet over low heat.</li>
        <li>Transfer the roasted bones and veggies back into the stockpot. Making sure to wash the pots after the bones were blanched and drained. Transfer and divide the roasted bones, onion, garlic, and ginger back to the stockpots. Scrape up any remaining bits and juices left in the roasting pan using a metal spatula and a little water, if needed. Add the pot with the bones.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil. With the bones, spice sachets, onion, garlic, and ginger divided between the two pots, fill each pot with approximately 12 cups water, 1/3 cup fish sauce and 2 tablespoons of sugar. Bring to a boil.

        </li>
        <li>Simmer the bones. Immediately reduce heat to low and simmer, with the lid slightly ajar, skimming any foam or excess fat, occasionally. Simmer for at least 6-12 hours, ideally 24 hours. Add more water if needed to make sure hte bones stay submerged.</li>
        <li>Strain the brother. Once the bones have simmered and your hot broth is ready, strain it through a fine-mesh strainer or colander into a clean pot. This separates the pretty, clear brother from the bones and spices.</li>
        <li>Season to taste. Add additional salt, soy sauce, fish sauce, sugar, to taste. Set aside the brother to cool.</li>
        <li>Don't forget about the meat. I can almost guarentee that there is a TON of delicious meat waiting to be picked from the bones. Don't let it go to waste! Discard the meat-free bones, herbs, and other bits that were used to make the broth, but save the meat and add to sandwiches, wraps, salads, or back to your broth.</li>
        <li>Skim the fat from the top. Add a couple of handfuls of ice to your broth to expidite cooling and cover your pot with a lid. Transfer the brother to the refigerator and allow the broth to cool fully. The result will be a hard, thick layer of fat on the top and a bottom layer that is your pho broth. If desired use a fork to scoop off the top layer of fat.</li>
    </ol>
